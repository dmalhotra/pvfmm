Installation Instructions
*************************

   This file describes how to compile and install PvFMM.  To install
PvFMM you will need atleast: MPI C++ compiler, BLAS and FFTW3 libraries.
The following section describes the installation steps.


Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.

   The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. The Doxygen source code documentation can be compiled using `make
     doxygen-doc' and documentation of algorithms, pseudocodes and 
     results can be compiled using `make pdf-doc'.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
     privileges.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

  6. To uninstall, `make uninstall'  removes the installation.


Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  In most cases, running
`./configure' will specify what options need to be specified manually.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure MPICXX="CC"


Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' installs the package's library under
`/usr/local/lib/pvfmm', header files under `/usr/local/include/pvfmm'
and data files under '/usr/local/shared/pvfmm'.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an absolute file name.


Troubleshooting
===============
Make sure that if you use special directories for compilers etc, that
your LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variables are set correctly (e.g.,
LD_LIBRARY_PATH on linux and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on macosx)


Particular systems
==================

  Configure options for some systems on which this package was tested
are given below:

`Titan (ORNL)'
     module load fftw
     module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-intel
     ./configure MPICXX="CC" F77="ftn"

`Stampede (TACC)' (CUDA build)
     module load fftw3 cuda
     ./configure CXXFLAGS="-mavx -wd3218 -wd2570 -no-offload" --with-fftw="$TACC_FFTW3_DIR" FLIBS=" " --with-cuda="$TACC_CUDA_DIR" NVCCFLAGS="-arch=compute_35 -code=sm_35"

`Stampede (TACC)' (Offload build)
     module load fftw3
     ./configure CXXFLAGS="-mavx -wd3218 -wd2570" --with-fftw="$TACC_FFTW3_DIR" FLIBS=" "

`Stampede (TACC)' (Native build)
     ./configure --host=x86_64-k1om-linux CXXFLAGS="-mmic -wd3218 -wd2570 -I$TACC_MKL_INC -DFFTW3_MKL" F77=ifort FFLAGS="-mmic" FLIBS=" " --with-fftw-include="$TACC_MKL_INC/fftw" --with-fftw-lib="-mkl"

`Ronaldo (ICES)'
     ./configure CXXFLAGS="-msse4" --with-fftw="$FFTW_DIR"

'Cafu (ICES)'
     ./configure CXXFLAGS="-mavx" --with-fftw="$FFTW_DIR" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib64/nvidia/" --with-cuda="$CUDA_DIR" NVCCFLAGS="-arch=compute_35 -code=sm_35"


`configure' Invocation
======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help=short'
     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
     `configure', and exit.

`--prefix=DIR'
     Use DIR as the installation prefix.

`MPICXX=<MPI-compiler>'
     Specify the MPI compiler and relevant flags.

`CC=<C-compiler>'
     Specify the C compiler and relevant flags.

`F77=<Fortran-compiler>'
     Specify the Fortran compiler and relevant flags.

`NVCCFLAGS=<nvcc flags>'
     Additional flags (eg: NVCCFLAGS="-arch=compute_30 -code=sm_30")

`--with-openmp-flag=FLAGS'
     FLAGS to enable OpenMP.

`--with-fftw=DIR'         
     Set FFTW installation directory to DIR

`--with-fftw-include=DIR'
     Set fftw3.h directory path to DIR

`--with-fftw-lib=LIB'
     Set FFTW library to LIB

`--with-blas=<lib>'
     Use BLAS library <lib>

`--with-lapack=<lib>'
     Use LAPACK library <lib>

`--with-cuda=PATH'
     Set to prefix where CUDA is installed [default=no]

`--with-precomp-dir=DIR'
     Set directory for precomputed data files to DIR. Default path is
     `PVFMM_DIR' environment variable if defined, or the current
     directory at execution.

`CXXFLAGS=-DUSE_SSE'
     To use SSE optimized imlementation of kernel functions.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.


`make' Invocation
======================

   The following is a list of the available target for make:

To compile the library: make
To install the library: make install
To compile all examples: make all-examples
To compile documentation: make doxygen-doc pdf-doc
