PvFMM Version 1.0.0 is the latest release (January 2014)


WHAT IS PvFMM?
==============

   PvFMM is a library for solving  certain types of elliptic partial
   differential equations. 
    
   * We support Stokes, Poisson, and Helmholtz problems on the unit
     cube, with free-space or periodic boundary conditions, with
     constant or mildly varying coefficients. Our method is based on
     volume potential integral equation formulation accelerated by the
     Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method. 


HOW TO GET PvFMM
================

   For the latest stable release of PvFMM 
       <URL: padas.ices.utexas.edu/pvmm.tgz>

LICENSE
=======

   PvFMM is distributed under the LGPLv3 licence. See COPYING in
   the top-level directory of the distribution. 

INSTALLING PvFMM
================

   To install PvFMM, follow the steps in the INSTALL file, which is
   located in the top directory of the source distribution. 


USING PvFMM
===========

   The file examples/Makefile can be used as a template makefile for any
   project using the library. In general the MakeVariables file should
   be included in any makefile and CXXFLAGS_PVFMM and LDFLAGS_FMM should
   be used to compile the code.

   Two very simple examples illustrating usage of the library are available:
      For particle N-body  : examples/src/example1.cpp
      For volume potentials: examples/src/example2.cpp 

   To compile these examples:
      make examples/bin/example1
      make examples/bin/example2

   * The volume potentials example will take a long time, the first time
     it is used, since it has to precompute quadrature rules. This data
     is saved to a file and used for subsequent runs. See INSTALL for
     the configure option '--with-precomp-dir=DIR' to set the default
     path for precomputed data.
